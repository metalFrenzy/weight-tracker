# weight-tracker-app

### This is a simple weight tracker app I developed using flutter, Firebase Auth, and firebase firestore.

The application lets users sign in or log in if they have an account, after the user has signed in the app shows the dashboard screen which the weight entries will be    viewed, and a button on the left to add a new weight entry. 
The weight entries will be sorted by the newest entry, users can delete or edit the weight entries.
